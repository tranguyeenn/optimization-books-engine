Im diagnosed with MDD. Whilst it isn’t a physical illness like Ivan had, it caused a disruption in my life which can affect people around me. How Tolstoy captures Ivan’s pov of the last few weeks he had was amazing, it shows how an illness can take over your life little by little until you draw your last breathe. It definitely changes my pov on life to just live because we all lived once and we should live our life to the fullest.</div>","","","",No
