    "description": "The father of the historical novel, Sir Walter Scott invented a literary form that has remained popular for over one hundred and fifty years. Infusing his works with romance, action, and suspense, he brought long-gone eras back to life with splendor and spectacle.Set in England just after the Third Crusade, Ivanhoe is the tale of Wilfrid, a young Saxon knight, and his love for the royal princess Rowena. With his father against their union, Wilfrid embarks on a series of adventures to prove his worth, finding himself in conflict against the Normans and the Templars, and allied with such larger-than-life figures as Robin Hood and Richard the Lion Hearted. A timeless story of courage, chivalry, and courtly love, Ivanhoe is a grand epic, and its place in classical literature is assured.",

    "description": "**In time for the 200th anniversary of her birth, a Penguin Hardcover Classics edition of the book many believe to be Charlotte Brontë's crowning achievement.**\r\n\r\nWith neither friends nor family, Lucy Snowe sets sail from England to find employment in a girls' boarding school in the small town of Villette. There she struggles to retain her self-possession in the face of unruly pupils, an initially suspicious headmaster, and her own complex feelings, first for the school's English doctor and then for the dictatorial professor Paul Emmanuel. Drawing on her own deeply unhappy experiences as a governess in Brussels, Charlotte Brontë's last and most autobiographical novel is a powerfully moving study of isolation and the pain of unrequited love. \r\n\r\nFor more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",

It is one of the most frequently dramatized of all novels. The influence of Treasure Island on popular perceptions of pirates is enormous, including treasure maps marked with an \"X\", schooners, the Black Spot, tropical islands, and one-legged seamen carrying parrots on their shoulders",

    "description": "*Edith Wharton wrote Ethan Frome as a frame story — meaning that the prologue and epilogue constitute a \"frame\" around the main story*\r\n\r\n**How It All Goes Down**\r\nIt's winter. A nameless engineer is in Starkfield, Massachusetts on business and he first sees Ethan Frome at the post office. Ethan is a man in his early fifties who is obviously strong, and obviously crippled. The man becomes fascinated with Ethan and wants to know his story. When Ethan begins giving him occasional rides to the train station, the two men strike up a friendship. One night when the weather is particularly bad, Ethan invites the man to stay at his house. In the hall the man hears a woman talking angrily, on and on. When Ethan speaks, the voice stops. The man tells us that he learned something that night which allowed him to imagine Ethan's story. Now we go back in time 24 years and learn about Ethan's life.\r\n\r\nEthan has walked from his farm and sawmill into town to pick up Mattie Silver from the church dance. He peeks in the windows of the church basement and sees Mattie dancing with Denis Eady and is jealous. Mattie is Ethan's wife's cousin. Her parents both died just over a year ago, and she was left with nothing. Her father had apparently swindled some of the relatives out of their savings, so nobody wanted to help Mattie. Zeena, Ethan's wife, is always sick, and decided to let Mattie live with them in exchange for doing the housework and helping the ailing Zeena.\r\n\r\nEthan liked Mattie from the beginning and worried that Zeena was too hard on her. The two women soon adjusted to each other (sort of) and things weren't as bad as they could have been. Meanwhile, Ethan has fallen in love with Mattie and wants to spend all his time with her.\r\n\r\nMattie soon comes out of the dance, and Ethan watches while Denis Eady tries to give her a ride home. She brushes him off and then Ethan reveals his presence. Ethan and Mattie are happy to see each other. They discuss possibly doing some sledding in the future. Neither is afraid to sled down the hill – at the bottom of which lies the deadly elm tree. The walk home is altogether lovely and romantic, but when they arrive, the house key isn't under the mat like it usually is.\r\n\r\nSoon, Zeena, looking ill and scary, comes downstairs and lets them in. She's usually in bed by this hour but she couldn't sleep. She is obviously suspicious of their behavior. The next day she announces that she will be gone overnight visiting a new doctor. Mattie and Ethan make good use of her absence and enjoy a romantic dinner for two. Unfortunately, the cat breaks Zeena's favorite dish and Ethan isn't able to locate any glue until after Zeena gets back. The first thing Zeena does when she gets home is to tell Ethan that she's kicking out Mattie. He protests, but fighting is useless. Then Zeena finds the broken pickle dish and is super upset (it had been a wedding gift).\r\n\r\nEthan decides he'll run away with Mattie, but then a combination of lack of cash and guilt stop him. Still, he insists on driving Mattie to the train station. He takes her on the long route, so they can look at different places they enjoyed together. By the time they get to the town sledding hill, it's already dark. As they are contemplating sledding, and pondering the hopelessness of their situation, Mattie suggests that they sled into the elm tree and kill themselves. Ethan agrees and they smash into the tree. But they survive.\r\n\r\nThen the story goes back to the present and we find the engineer right where we left him, about to enter the Frome kitchen. When he does enter he learns that the woman who was talking on and on in an argumentative tone is…Mattie! She has spinal disease and can't move without assistance. Zeena is there too, cooking. They all three live together, an unhappy family in the Frome house.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nAlso contained in: \r\n\r\n - [Age of Innocence / The House of Mirth / Ethan Frome](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20577050W)\r\n - [Edith Wharton Reader](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL98540W/The_Edith_Wharton_reader)\r\n - [Ethan Frome and Other Stories](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15000117W/Ethan_Frome_and_other_stories)\r\n - [Ethan Frome and Related Readings][1]\r\n - [Ethan Frome and Selected Stories](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15000119W/Ethan_Frome_and_Selected_Stories)\r\n - [Edith Wharton Omnibus](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL98499W/The_Edith_Wharton_Omnibus)\r\n - [Ethan Frome with Connections](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15000126W/Ethan_Frome_with_Connections)\r\n - [The Hermit and the Wild Woman and other stories / Ethan Frome](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL13131348W/Ethan_Frome_The_Hermit_and_the_Wild_Woman_and_other_stories)\r\n - [Novellas and Other Writings](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15000211W/Novellas_and_other_writings)\r\n - [Three Classics by American Women][2]\r\n - [Three Novels](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15000264W/Three_Novels)\r\n - [Works of Edith Wharton](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL98524W/Works_of_Edith_Wharton)\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16061406W/Ethan_Frome_and_Related_Readings\r\n  [2]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15514881W/Three_Classics_by_American_Women_(The_Awakening_Ethan_Frome_O_Pioneers!",

Baum wrote this story in the hope of interesting his readers in something other than Oz; in the preface he writes: \"I hope my readers who have so long followed Dorothy's adventures in the Land of Oz will be interested in Trot's equally strange experiences.\" Of course, he did not succeed in distracting his fans from Oz, yet the book was eagerly read; the result of this attempt was that he was forced to introduce Trot and Cap'n Bill into the later Oz stories.",

    "description": "\"Zenith is the finest example of American life and prosperity to be found anywhere.\" Zenith is the Midwestern city where George F. Babbitt lives and works. A successful real estate agent, his business provides all the material trappings and comfort he thinks he ought to have. He is a member of all the right clubs, and unquestioningly shares the same aspirations and ideas as his friends and fellow Boosters. Yet even complacent, conformist Babbitt dreams of romance and escape, and when his best friend does something to throw his world upside down, he rebels, and tries to find fulfilment in romantic adventures and liberal thinking. Hilarious and poignant, Babbitt turns the spotlight on middle America and strips bare the hypocrisy of business practice, social mores, politics, and religious institutions. A brilliant satire, it evokes an era and at the same time exposes a universal social malaise. In his introduction and notes Gordon Hutner explores the novel's historical and literary contexts, and its rich cultural and social references. - Back cover.\r\n\r\nWith his portrait of George F. Babbit, the conniving, prosperous real-estate man from Zenith, Sinclair Lewis created one of the ugliest, but most convincing, figures in American fiction -- the total conformist. Babbitt's demons are power in his community and the self-esteem he can only receive from others. In his attempts to reconcile these aspirations, he is loyal to whoever serves his need of the moment: time and again he proves an opportunist in business practice and in domestic affairs. Outwardly he conforms with \"zip and zowie,\" is a \"big booster\" before the public eye; inwardly he converges day by day upon the utter emptiness of his soul -- too filled with rationalizations and sentimentality to sense his own corruption. Babbit gives consummate expression to the glibness and irresponsibility of the hardened, professional social climber. H. G. Wells said of this novel: \"I wish I could have written Babbitt.\"",

Her sentimental companion Amelia, however, longs only for caddish soldier George. As the two heroines make their way through the tawdry glamour of Regency society, battles - military and domestic - are fought, fortunes made and lost. The one steadfast and honourable figure in this corrupt world is Dobbin with his devotion to Amelia, bringing pathos and depth to Thackeray's gloriously satirical epic of love and social adventure.",

Unable to believe their eyes, they promptly set out to find some men, convinced that since this is a civilized country--there must be men. So begins this sparkling utopian novel, a romp through a whole world \"masculine\" and \"feminine\", as on target today as when it was written 65 years ago.",

    "description": "A stark and allegorical tale of adultery, guilt, and social repression in Puritan New England, The Scarlet Letter is a foundational work of American literature. Nathaniel Hawthorne's exploration of the dichotomy between the public and private self, internal passion and external convention, gives us the unforgettable Hester Prynne, who discovers strength in the face of ostracism and emerges as a heroine ahead of her time.",
